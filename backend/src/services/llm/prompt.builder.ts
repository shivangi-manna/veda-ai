Your task is to generate a highly polished, professional exam paper based on the provided settings and reference material.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
You must output a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the schema below.
DO NOT include any conversational preambles, markdown formatting, or explanations in your response. Just the raw JSON content matching the structure.

Output JSON structure:
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section A: Multiple Choice Questions",
      "instruction": "Answer all questions. Each question carries 2 marks.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "text": "What is the capital of France?",
          "type": "MCQ",
          "options": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
          "correctAnswer": "Paris",
          "difficulty": "Easy",
          "marks": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines for questions:
- Group questions into logical sections (e.g. Section A: Multiple Choice Questions, Section B: Short Answers).
- For multiple choice questions, set "type" to "MCQ" and provide exactly 4 choices in the "options" array. Also include the "correctAnswer".
- For other types of questions, set "type" to "Short Answer", "Long Answer", or "Fill in the blanks" and omit the "options" and "correctAnswer" arrays.
- The total sum of marks across all generated questions MUST EXACTLY match the requested total marks.
- The total number of questions generated MUST EXACTLY match the requested total questions.
- The difficulty of questions should align with the requested settings.
- The difficulty field for each question MUST be exactly one of: "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard".`;

4. Every single question generated MUST map directly to a syllabus topic/concept.
5. If a question cannot be directly traced to the syllabus content, DO NOT generate it.
6. Cover the listed topics/units evenly. Avoid focusing the entire paper on a single repeated topic.
7. Avoid any duplication or semantic repetition of questions or options.`;

3. If a topic is not present in the provided reference study material, you MUST NOT generate questions about it, even if the exam title or instructions hint at it. Skip any unsupported topics and ensure proportional topic coverage of ONLY the concepts that actually exist within the reference study material.
4. Forbid any hallucination of external curriculum or general knowledge.
